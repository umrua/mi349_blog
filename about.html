        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Muhammad Umar, and I'm a student in my senior year at Michigan State University in the Communication Arts & Sciences college. I'm currently studying for my Bachelors of Arts in Information Science, as well as a secondary major in Games & Interactive Media. I hope to progress my knowledge and expertise in IT networking and systems administration, as well as my skills in web development!
        </p>

        I am also an avid consumer of fantasy fiction. My free time is largely spent reading, watching, discussing, and daydreaming about fantasy stories with rich worldbuilding and unique stories. Here's a list of a few series that I've really enjoyed!:
            <ul>
                <li>The Apothecary Diaries by Natsu Hyuuga</li>
                <li>Michael Vey by Richard Paul Evans</li>
                <li>Solo Leveling by Chugong</li>               
                <li>Ranger's Apprentice by John Flanagan</li>
                <li>One Piece by Eiichiro Oda</li>
            </ul>
